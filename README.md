**Abstract:** Closely related organisms are expected to have similar functional traits due to shared ancestry and trait heritability. However, few tests of this hypothesis are available for plant-associated fungal symbionts. Fungal leaf endophytes are a ubiquitous group of microbes that can protect their host plant from disease by a variety of mechanisms, including mycoparasitism of fungal pathogens. Here, we tested whether phylogenetic relatedness among species of *Cladosporium*, a widespread genus that includes mycoparasitic species, predicts endophyte antagonism of cottonwood leaf rust disease. First, we used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to infer phylogenetic relationships among 96 *Cladosporium* isolates collected from wild cottonwood trees growing in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Next, we conducted a double inoculation experiment (endophyte first, then pathogen) for a subset of 50 isolates for which we quantified both mycoparasitism and disease modification. MLST identified 17 species of *Cladosporium*; all of the species reduced rust disease severity in our experiment. *Cladosporium* phylogeny was a significant predictor of mycoparasitism. However, we did not observe a phylogenetic effect on disease severity overall, indicating that other mechanism/s operating independently of shared ancestry also contributed to endophyte effects on disease severity. In a second inoculation experiment, endophyte exudates alone (no live organism) from all *Cladosporium* isolates were also found to reduce disease severity. Our results reveal that multiple mechanisms, including phylogenetic relatedness, can contribute to the protective effects of an endophyte against a plant pathogen.
